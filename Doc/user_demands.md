<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Account of functionalities expected by users
  <br/>
  <br/>

- Develop an intuitive system comprehensible to all, especially the elderly, and simple to update and maintain (avoid overly complex features).
- Distinguish daytime and nighttime schedules, as well as overtime hours.
- Ensure that the system does not give the impression that time matters more than the quality of work.
- Prioritize a few excellent metrics over numerous metrics.
- Avoid presenting an easier option that requires more work later, as most individuals may be reluctant to complete the entire procedure. Prefer a solution that can be implemented gradually.
- Some individuals gonna have variable schedules, find a way to implement it.
- Implement a pre-defined schedule.
- Clearly indicate whether a person is authorized to work overtime.
- Separate overtime hours from regular hours in the dashboard.
- Keep the system from being overly detailed to prevent hostility.
- Strive to avoid creating a sense of constant surveillance.
- Determine lunch break time or provide a button for employees to choose. (Selected option: a mix of both)
- Define overtime work hours/days (some companies consider only weekends).
- Decide when to automatically stop recording time; consider sending an email for employees to input their departure time from the previous day. Alternatively, if an employee clocks in the morning, automatically record the previous day's clock-out time.
- Allow the system to be accessible on mobile phones and computers.
- Establish a connection between the bat signal and the application to facilitate communication with the appropriate team at the right moment.
- Enable the adjustment of salaries for specific periods, such as hazard pay for nights and additional compensation for Sundays.
- Incorporate mandatory rest periods, like the 11 hours of required sleep.
- Include features for vacations, leaves, public holidays, and sick leave.
- Highlight the number of night shifts, overtime hours per month.
Differentiate between various schedules, overtime hours, night shifts, 40-hour overtime, and unpaid hours.
